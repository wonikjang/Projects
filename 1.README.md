# Demand for Variety: Bayesian Hierarchical model with Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model

Consumers commonly choose more than one variety of a product within the category for a shopping trip. To explain simultaneous demand for multiple alternatives that are imperfect substitutes for one another, the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model introduced parsimonious approach to handle multi-unit choices. The underlying assumption of demand is based on the transformed and generalized variant of the translated CES utility function.The baseline preferences of different choices and satiation parameters are captured by applying adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo directly into likelihood function of a Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model.

# Tax and Outcomes: The Case of Alcohol

The most fundamental law of economics establishes a relationship between the price of a product and the demand for that product. Accordingly, much of alcohol tax policy is geared towards a dual objective of increasing tax revenue and reducing the consumption of hard alcohol products. One objective of higher taxes on spirits (as opposed to beers and wine) is to decrease the consumption of spirits and induce consumers to purchase products with less alcohol. However, there is little empirical support that such taxes lead to product substitution. This paper investigates the impact of taxes on consumer choices of alcohol products. I show that the effect of excise taxation increase on switching to heavy alcohol products is prevalent for most of alcohol type (Gin, Scotch, Whiskey, and Vodka) in Illinois based on store-level scanner data. The average market share of high alcohol products for the Rum type alcohol increased drastically in the financial distress, just before the spirits excise tax increase in Illinois.

# Predicting Changes in Neighborhood Rent using Restaurant Reviews and Attributes

Using restaurant reviews scraped from Yelp, we performed sentiment analysis and a study of different writing styles contained in the reviews to extract information about the average rent price in New York City neighborhoods.
Our initial idea was to try to predict rent in a neighborhood based on 1) the kinds of restaurants opening in that neighborhood and 2) the rate of restaurant openings in the neighborhood. Due to certain obstacles with data availability (Fig. 1 and 2) we reframed our project to focus on restaurant review data. First we created sentiment analysis model by using CoreNLP to clean the review texts (remove punctuation, digits, and stop words such as “place,” “food,” etc.) for all data. Then we used “pos-tagging” to extract nouns and adjectives and generate a word cloud (Fig. 3). Then we calculated the ratio of positive and negative words to total words for each restaurant in each year, using Hu and Liu, KDD-2004's list of positive and negative words as a dictionary [1].
The second model used word2vec trained on 20% of reviews to create 20 different “writing styles.” We then ran k-means on this vectored output with k=20 using Spark ML, created an array of size 20 and grouped the reviews using the array index as the key for the review style. For a given year, the model looks one year back to see what writing styles that year contained compared the the current year. Using the vector found, the model predicts the rent increase or decrease for one year in the future. There are six categories: 1) rent rises by between $0-100; 2) rent rises by between $100-200; 3) rent rises by more than $200; 4) no change; 5) rent decreases between $0-100; 6) rent decreases by between $100-200; 7) rent decreases by more than $200.
