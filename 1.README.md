# Demand for Variety: Bayesian Hierarchical model with Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model

Consumers commonly choose more than one variety of a product within the category for a shopping trip. To explain simultaneous demand for multiple alternatives that are imperfect substitutes for one another, the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model introduced parsimonious approach to handle multi-unit choices. The underlying assumption of demand is based on the transformed and generalized variant of the translated CES utility function.The baseline preferences of different choices and satiation parameters are captured by applying adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo directly into likelihood function of a Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model.

# Tax and Outcomes: The Case of Alcohol

The most fundamental law of economics establishes a relationship between the price of a product and the demand for that product. Accordingly, much of alcohol tax policy is geared towards a dual objective of increasing tax revenue and reducing the consumption of hard alcohol products. One objective of higher taxes on spirits (as opposed to beers and wine) is to decrease the consumption of spirits and induce consumers to purchase products with less alcohol. However, there is little empirical support that such taxes lead to product substitution. This paper investigates the impact of taxes on consumer choices of alcohol products. I show that the effect of excise taxation increase on switching to heavy alcohol products is prevalent for most of alcohol type (Gin, Scotch, Whiskey, and Vodka) in Illinois based on store-level scanner data. The average market share of high alcohol products for the Rum type alcohol increased drastically in the financial distress, just before the spirits excise tax increase in Illinois.
