# Demand for Variety: Bayesian Hierarchical model with Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model

Consumers commonly choose more than one variety of a product within the category for a shopping trip. To explain simultaneous demand for multiple alternatives that are imperfect substitutes for one another, the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model introduced parsimonious approach to handle multi-unit choices. The underlying assumption of demand is based on the transformed and generalized variant of the translated CES utility function.The baseline preferences of different choices and satiation parameters are captured by applying adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo directly into likelihood function of a Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model.
